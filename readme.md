# __Retail and Marketing Analytics Project__

## Introduction

Here, our main task/goal is to develop a practical tool that supports high-impact marketing decisions in an e-commerce setting. our focus is on leveraging data-driven insights to improve demand forecasting, assess the effectiveness of promotions, and optimise pricing strategies for a diverse product line.

We have been tasked with creating a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights to support the marketing team in planning for the upcoming periods.

## Dataset overview

For this project, we are using a dataset obtained from the book [*demand prediction in retail - a practical guide to leverage data and predictive analytics*](https://demandprediction.github.io/dataset.html) by Cohen et al. (2022).

The dataset, originally sourced from an online electronics retailer, has been anonymised and slightly modified to ensure confidentiality. It consists of weekly sales data for 44 stock-keeping units (SKUs) spanning a period of 100 weeks, from October 2016 to September 2018.

The data includes key attributes such as pricing, promotions, and sales figures, aggregated at the week-SKU level. while initially collected at the transaction level, it has been restructured to provide a more practical format for analysis.  

Our approach to demand prediction is adaptable across various retail settings, including both e-commerce and physical stores, making it applicable to a wide range of industries.

## Project objectives

The primary objective of our project is to develop an interactive marketing mix dashboard using **R** or **Python**, which will address key business questions such as:

- **Predictions:** providing demand forecasts to support strategic planning.  

- **Metrics:** evaluating the effectiveness of promotional efforts.  

- **Visualisations:** presenting data-driven insights to support pricing and marketing decisions.

This dashboard will serve as a valuable tool to empower "a marketing team" with data-driven decision-making capabilities.

## Key analysis areas

Our analysis focuses on three critical areas:

### Demand forecasting

Objective: to predict demand for each SKU in the upcoming periods.

Our approach: Implementation of regression and neural network models to generate demand forecasts.  Also the development of visual forecast displays, incorporating confidence intervals to provide a measure of uncertainty.  

---

### Feature promotions effectiveness

Objective: to assess whether feature promotions effectively boost demand and quantify their impact.

Our approach: The application of the SCAN*PRO model (or an alternative approach) to evaluate the impact of feature promotions.  Also, the measurement of incremental sales attributed to promotions, with clear visualisations to highlight significant changes in demand.  

---

### price elasticity and scenario testing

Objective: to determine how sensitive SKUs are to price changes and evaluate potential revenue impacts.

Our approach: The calculation of price elasticity for each SKU to understand responsiveness to price fluctuations.  Also, the simulation of demand changes under various price increase and decrease scenarios (5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%).

## Dashboard and presentation

We aim to design an intuitive and well-organised dashboard that effectively addresses the marketing managerâ€™s key questions.
Additionally, we will prepare a concise presentation summarising our findings, addressing each of the marketing manager's questions with actionable insights and recommendations.

## Deliverables

The success of our project will be evaluated based on the following key criteria:

- **Demand forecast accuracy:** ensuring reliable and precise demand forecasts for each SKU.

- **Insights into promotion effectiveness:** providing a clear understanding of incremental sales generated by promotions.

- **Price sensitivity analysis:**  evaluating the impact of price changes on demand and revenue with actionable insights.

- **Dashboard clarity and usability:** delivering a user-friendly dashboard that facilitates informed decision-making for the marketing team.
